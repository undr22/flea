# Flea - A Tiny Static Website Generator

Flea reads a content folder with a defined structure and parses Markdown files to generate a static website.

**Usage:**

```shell
cd path_to_flea
pip install -r requirements.txt
python flea.py content_folder_path
```

The content folder should include at least `index.md`, along with a folder named `imgs` containing all the local images.

You can place other Markdown files directly in the content folder, or you can create folders as needed for organization (_just avoid naming them "imgs"_). Flea will automatically assist you in organizing the website structure.

Have fun! Or [jump onto the manual](https://undr22.github.io/programming/flea-doc.html).
